# Lab11
Project based on two sprites so I extracted some animals png from kenny's Website, credit to Kenny. Instances of scene so instead of forest and trees with different color, i pivoted to png rocks and broken rocks perharps on a mountain. What I learned based from this project is that Sprites are linked to Main Scene, and Rocky(Mountain) linked to Main Scene and overall visiblity all ties back to the whole main itself. Debugging to allow to see input changes, and the movement of x and y coordination when dragging png. Also creating branch to scene so I can branch multiple similar pngs while just creating a png in another scene.
